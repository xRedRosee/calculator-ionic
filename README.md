## Calculator with Ionic Framework

I created a calculator using the hybrid framework Ionic. I used it in combination with Vue.

### Why Ionic?

Ionic is open source and you can create apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can either choose if you want to work with Angular, React or with Vue. Ionic has great documentation and also their own components you can work with. This allows you to create apps very fast without having to spend to much time working on the styling.

## Why Vue?

I choose Vue because I already knew how to use this framework and thinks it's quite handful when creating apps. You can easily create one component and use it multiple times.

## Version of Ionic

Ionic version 7, in combination of Vue 3 and JavaScript.

## Appfunctionality

You can type in a number, then an opperator and a number again and press the equals button to find out the answer. If you want to do another calculation, press in the clear button.

## Installation

### Startup on desktop

- Go into the files folder where you want to install the Calculator code map.

- Open your terminal and fill in the following npm command:
- `TO BE ADDED`

- You have to make sure youâ€™re now in the Ionic Calculator folder, if not then go into this folder with
- `$ cd calculator-ionic`

- To make the application work, you need to install the npm packages. You can do this with the following npm commands:
- `$ npm install`

- Now all the right npm packages are installed and you only need to run the application!
- Run it with the following command:
- `$ ionic serve`
- This will open the application on a local host server.
